# Candlestick Pattern Prediction

This project implements a Candlestick Pattern Prediction system for stock market analysis.

## Overview

The system predicts candlestick patterns in stock market data using machine learning models.

### Frontend

The frontend provides a user interface to visualize and interact with the stock market data and the predicted candlestick patterns.

### Backend

The backend handles data processing, machine learning model training, and prediction of candlestick patterns based on historical stock market data.

## How It Works

The system utilizes historical stock market data, applies machine learning algorithms to recognize patterns in the data, and predicts future candlestick patterns.

## Usage

To use this system:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up the necessary environment and dependencies.
3. Run the backend server to handle data processing and predictions.
4. Access the frontend interface to visualize the predicted candlestick patterns.

## Technologies Used

- Python for backend data processing and machine learning
- Frontend framework (mention the framework if applicable)
